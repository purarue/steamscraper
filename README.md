# steamscraper

Scrapes game/achievement data from steams website.

Doesn't seem to be a simple way to download the data using the GDPR site, this is a thrown together `selenium` implementation. Assumes you have [`selenium`](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/) setup.

I'm not sure if some of these pages are paginated or not, I don't use steam that actively. It seems to be all of the data though.

Saves:

- image URL
- hours on record
- achievements

To minimize pain and suffering resulting from webscrapings, `scrape.py` is as generic as possible when scraping, and saves the entire HTML contents of the pages. Then `extract` tries to parse that into the values I want.

---

Requires `python3.7+`

```
git clone https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/steamscraper
cd steamscraper
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
# username is the one that works here: https://steamcommunity.com/id/<steam_username>/games?tab=all
python3 ./scrape.py <steam_username> --to-file ./data.json
python3 ./parse.py --from-file ./data.json --to-file ./parsed.json
python3 ./demo.py --from-file  ./parsed.json
```

---

In `parsed.json`, each contains how many hours, the image, and achievement data/when you earned the achievements.

Dates are serialized to epoch time, if possible.
