# steamscraper

Scrapes game/achievement data from steams website.

Doesn't seem to be a simple way to download the data using the [GDPR site](https://help.steampowered.com/en/accountdata), this is a thrown together `selenium` implementation. Assumes you have [`selenium`](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html) setup/a `chromedriver` binary on your `$PATH` somewhere.

I'm not sure if some of these pages are paginated or not, I don't use steam that actively. It seems to be all of the data though.

Saves:

- image URL
- hours on record
- achievements

Since 2FA is enabled on my account, this just asks you to manually log in after the chromedriver opens, it doesnt try to automatically log in. Prompts you to hit enter once you're logged in, which then starts the scraping process

To minimize pain and suffering resulting from webscraping, `scrape.py` is as generic as possible when scraping, and saves the entire HTML contents of the pages. Then `parse.py` tries to parse that into the values I want.

Primarily written to get historical achievement data, to plug into `my.games.steam` for [`HPI`](https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/HPI)

Requires `python3.7+`

```
git clone https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/steamscraper
cd steamscraper
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
# username is the one that works here: https://steamcommunity.com/id/<steam_username>/games?tab=all
python3 ./scrape.py <steam_username> --to-file ./data.json
python3 ./parse.py --from-file ./data.json --to-file ./parsed.json
python3 ./demo.py --from-file  ./parsed.json
```

---

In `parsed.json`, each contains how many hours, the image, and achievement data/when you earned the achievements.

Dates are serialized to epoch time, if possible.
